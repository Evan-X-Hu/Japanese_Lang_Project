Feature + data to store:

Feature: Track users to associate data w/ user
User:
- First, Middle, Last Name
- Email
- Password (hashed)

Feature: Japanese content directory
1. Create a directory that stores a piece of Japanese content
   Per each user.
2. Have each Japanese content display in a list. Have it display:
   - Name of content/video
   - Name of creator (if available)
   - Link to content/video
   - Duration
3. Be able to click into each content and view the audio & subtitles
   - Also be able to click a sentence and have it play from
     the audio track (might be stretch)
4. (Later problem) Data storage efficiency
   - Should I make a centralized storage for all media, what if they update?
   - Should I store data on my server or somehow leverage user's machines?

   For now, I think make a centralized storage and have it assign content
   to users via another data table.

   And then I need a way for users to uniquely search for content
   or when they try to download a link, it will query the database
   first for that link.
   --> Need to know what uniquely identifies a video
